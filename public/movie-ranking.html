<h3>The Drunkin Master</h3>

<p>
    "Drunken Master" (1978) is a kung fu<br />
film starring Jackie Chan as Wong Fei-hung,<br />
a young, rebellious martial artist who is <br />
forced to train with his uncle, a gruff master <br />
of the "Drunken Fist" style of kung fu. <br />
This style involves incorporating the erratic <br />
movements of a drunk person into fighting techniques. <br />
Wong's initial disobedience and arrogance lead him <br />
to be sent to his uncle's harsh training, <br />
but he eventually learns to control and master <br />
the drunken style, showcasing the power of discipline <br />
and overcoming adversity.

<h3>Ipman Movie</h3>

<p>
    The "Ip Man" movie series tells the story of Ip Man, <br />
    a Wing Chun grandmaster and Bruce Lee's teacher, <br />
primarily set in the 1930s and 1940s. The films focus on <br />
events in his life during the Sino-Japanese War, <br />
including his time in Foshan and later in Hong Kong.

<h3>Kung Fu Hustle</h3>

<p>
Kung Fu Hustle" is a live-action cartoon-style martial arts <br />
comedy film that blends kung fu action with slapstick humor <br />
and a touch of Looney Tunes conventions. The film follows a <br />
small-time gangster named Sing who accidentally discovers the <br />
legendary kung fu masters and their village. While the film <br />
features extreme violence, it's often presented in a lighthearted <br />
and exaggerated way, drawing comparisons to classic cartoon styles.
