            a young, rebellious martial artist who is forced to train with his uncle, a gruff master <br />
            of the "Drunken Fist" style of kung fu.This style involves incorporating the erratic movements<br />
            of a drunk person into fighting techniques. Wong's initial disobedience and arrogance lead him <br />
            to be sent to his uncle's harsh training, but he eventually learns to control and master the drunken<br />
            style, showcasing the power of discipline and overcoming adversity.

    <h6>Ipman Movie</h6>    
        <p>
            The "Ip Man" movie series tells the story of Ip Man, a Wing Chun grandmaster and Bruce Lee's teacher,<br />
            primarily set in the 1930s and 1940s. The films focus on events in his life during the Sino-Japanese War, <br />
            including his time in Foshan and later in Hong Kong.
        </p>  

    <h6>Kung Fu Hustle</h6>          
            
         <p>
            Kung Fu Hustle" is a live-action cartoon-style martial arts comedy film that blends kung fu action <br />
            with slapstick humor and a touch of Looney Tunes conventions. The film follows a small-time gangster <br />
            named Sing who accidentally discovers the legendary kung fu masters and their village. While the <br />
            film features extreme violence, it's often presented in a lighthearted and exaggerated way, drawing <br />
            comparisons to classic cartoon styles.
